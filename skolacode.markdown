&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As mentioned in the about me page, this is my long term goal. The SkolaCode idea came to me after I realised that in my home country “Malaysia” ![Malaysian Flag](assets/malaysia_flag.png), we have very limited professional programmers. We don’t even have a proper youtube channel in Bahasa Melayu for any coding tutorials. I totally understand the limited resources and market in Malaysia for coding, so that is why I plan to start this code school. This will definitely impact many Malaysian programmers channels, websites and government sites. With the hope of contributing a good young prospect to the country and for my own satistication I started this. This is my baby steps, I have a Facebook Page and Website. Besides that I really love teaching. Let's hope I succeed in my journey.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I try to post every week on my facebook page about tech. Will migrate it to the Skolacode website soon. Please visit and **`LIKE`** SkolaCode facebook page
