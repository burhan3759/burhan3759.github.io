&nbsp; This is a short story but not a bad story :sweat_smile:. First let’s see who is V and why I name it V. V is wonderful and awsome school friend. Why name it V, it is simple, because the person goes by this acronym :joy:. To make this story interesting I will use the word "She" because I am a "He". Having the opposite gender in a story will make it more interesting for a reader. Now, let’s get into the story with story mode ON.

`Story Mode: ON`

It’s been years since me & V did not catch up. Luckly me, the wind flew my way and V cast her way to my island. It was so good to get back our old friend. We catch up many things and it is good enough to know more about each others more :innocent:. We had a great journey throughout the year and we did some good and awesome things too :swimmer:.

We had many promises and planned to fulfill it as soon as possible but COVID :mask: hit the world and it is delayed. So after everything calms down a bit, I try to fulfill our promises. But V, as usual, ghosted :ghost: around and enjoyed the world.

One day, I tried to set up a plan that is on our checklist. The ghosting is becoming worse and the reply is like a youtube buffer with 2g connection :unamused:. I was concerned about V, afraid something that is not good could happen to V. Luckily V replied the next day. She said, she had some unavoidable issues and needs to focus on it. The first reply from me is laugh :rofl:. I say to V, good and go for it :thumbsup:.

As usual I give a great wish and ask V to focus on it. Here comes the worst part. V did not reply and ghost me again. V should learn to say `Thank You and See You Around`. So I take this as a `"WORST GOODBYE EVER"`. If V comes again to my island I will request V to buy me an expensive nasi lemak :rice: :poultry_leg: . That’s the punishment. Yes, I am dead serious :triumph:.

Final words, Be happy :sunglasses: and focus on what is important V. Take Care buddy :star2: :tada:.
