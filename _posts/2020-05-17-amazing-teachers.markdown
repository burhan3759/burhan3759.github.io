&nbsp; Who I am now is 100% because of my teachers :man_teacher: :woman_teacher:, there is no doubt in it. I have been blessed with an awesome `teachers` since my kindergarten. When I start realizing about kindergarten, I always think kindergarten is useless, but when I grow older and older, I realize kindergarten is the root of my success. My teachers really plant a healthy root in me, I will start this topic with Thank You Teachers.

## Teachers

&nbsp; Teachers are amazing human beings that give without expecting anything in return. In Malay, we have a saying ‚ÄúCikgu umpama lilin yang membakar dirinya‚Äù; it means, teachers are like a candle :candle: that will burn itself in order to give light to others. I believe this kind of similar saying exists all around the world. My first teacher is my mom üßï, the best teacher in my life. When I grew older and older I realized that the things that my `mom` bought for me and time spent with me shaped me. I feel blessed and awesome at the same time, after realizing that I always buy the same thing that my mom buy for me for other kids instead of dress :satisfied:

## Primary Teachers

&nbsp; I had this amazing teacher when I was in standard 2. I was 8 y/o that time and I am kinda naughty in my house and super duper shy and lazy in schools. But I scored not bad on the exam despite not doing my homework almost all the time. I did not remember this teacher not accurately. This is the saddest part, if i am not wrong the teacher's name is `Nurliza`. She taught me BM (Bahasa Melayu) and Maths (Mathematics). Her tactics are really awesome, one of the reasons I score ‚ÄúA‚Äù in subject BM until SPM is because of her. Her math teaching skills are insane. I have 2 awesome math teachers, and I proudly say these are the teachers who are responsible for my math skills. The other teacher‚Äôs name I can remember accurately, `Suzana`.

&nbsp; Their way is a bit harsh but really effective, teacher ‚ÄúNurliza‚Äù will come to class and ask all students to stand up, she will ask the math question and whoever is able to answer it can sit. This creates a healthy competition among students and automatically makes us self study without any force ü§©. Teacher ‚ÄúSuzana‚Äù uses a cool and interactive method to teach the maths and when you don't get the answer you will get a slap. It is not pain but the name of the slap makes you scared and will make you self study ‚ÄúPelempang Jepun‚Äù.

<br />

&nbsp; Actually the list will keep going, there are so many awesome teachers I had. Let me list another two, teacher ‚ÄúAshikin‚Äù and ‚ÄúHaslinda‚Äù. If one day any of my teachers read through this I am really sorry not to mention you guys, all of you guys are really awesome and wonderful. Let's see teacher ‚ÄúHaslinda‚Äù first, she is my english teacher. Best of the best, she is a really strict teacher but the knowledge that she gives is not comparable. She uses the same tactics as my math teachers, she will give a list of words and ask us to remember. When she comes to class all of us cannot sit until we spell the word when she asks for it. Every student will compete with each other and answer as soon as possible. It was really a golden time. Teacher ‚ÄúAshikin‚Äù is my chess teacher, because until today I still play chess. One of the best brain games ever, she trusted me and chose me to represent school. It may seem normal to her but for me it really is something. Thank you teacher, every time I play chess I remember of you.

## Secondary Teachers

&nbsp; My Secondary teachers are one of a kind, all of them are so cool and really give knowledge purely for our success in future. One of the best among them is ‚ÄúTAF‚Äù Tong Ah Fook, he is my accounts teacher. He really / literally stayed with us and helped us do the assignment, he forced us to come to school and guide us step by step. He is really awesome, he will make sure even the laziest person scores in his subject, because he knows one day the scores might help his students.

&nbsp; Another best teacher is ‚ÄúPn Paridah‚Äù, she was my class teacher when I was in form 5. She literally calls my parents and makes sure they come to ‚ÄúReport Card‚Äù day. I never tell my parents about ‚ÄúReport Card‚Äù day and like I say, my parents are the best teacher so they don‚Äôt push us. They always let us learn what we love and guide us when we do something wrong. Even though final year exams i always score not bad results but my other exams i usually score really really bad. So I never invited my parents to come, this time she called them and made them come. She told my parents about me being talkative and not doing homework, but the next year she was the one who praised me. Most of the Teachers always have a pure soul, they do things for our own good. There are many more teachers in my secondary school that are awesome but these two teachers really touched me. Special mention is cikgu ‚ÄúQudzi‚Äù. Thank you Teachers for coloring my life.

## College

&nbsp; In college I met with awesome gurus, they are not like primary and secondary teachers. They care a bit less but they are genuine. They teach with pure heart and make sure they deliver it properly. I will mention all of them I guess, because these lectures are the one who made me ready for the working world. `Pn Siti Salina, Miss Cheah, Mr Salzatore, Mr Shahab, Mr John, Miss Vasugi`. No bias but my programming teachers are super cool, I am a good programmer now because of them. I really need to give this credit to `Mr Salvatore` :man_teacher:. He teaches me Java and because of his teaching style I become so good at programming. Thank You Teachers.

## Special Teachers

&nbsp; These are special people who teach me out of school, first of all are my parents. My `mom` teaches me about schools and my `dad` üßî on the other hand teaches me different skills. He teaches me indirectly and directly, so many things. One of the best things is when I was around 10 y/o he did the discount calculation and I am so amazed with it. How he does it, then he teaches me and until now I use that method. Besides that, not trusting and always knowing the rules is the biggest thing I learn from him. Second is `Faiz`, this is another amazing teacher in my life. This is the person who makes me a teacher. He teaches me about computers and their way of learning. All of these are awesome golden memories, and now I learn many things from people around me. Last but not least Thank You Teachers.
