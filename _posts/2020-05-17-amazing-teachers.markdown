&nbsp; Who I am now is 100% because of my teachers :man_teacher: :woman_teacher:, there is no doubt in it. I have been blessed with awesome `teachers` since my kindergarten. When I start realizing about kindergarten, I always think kindergarten is useless. When I grow older and older, I realize that kindergarten is the root of my success. My teachers planted a healthy root in me, I will start this topic with `Thank You Teachers`.

## Teachers

&nbsp; Teachers are amazing human beings that give without expecting anything in return. In Malay, we have a saying ‚ÄúCikgu umpama lilin yang membakar dirinya‚Äù; it means, teachers are like a candle :candle: that will burn itself in order to give light to others. I believe this kind of similar saying exists all around the world. My first teacher is my `mom` üßï. She is the best teacher in my life. When I grew older and older I started to realize that the things that my `mom` bought for me and the time that she spent with me really shaped me. After realized that, I always buy the same thing that my mom buy for me when I was kid instead of dresses :wink:

## Primary Teachers

&nbsp; I had these amazing teachers when I was in standard 2. I was 8 y/o that time and I am kinda naughty at home and super duper shy and lazy in school. But my exam results are not bad despite not doing my homework almost all the time :rofl:. Sadly I did not remember this teacher's name accurately, if I am not wrong the teacher's name is `Nurliza`. She taught me BM (Bahasa Melayu) and Maths (Mathematics). Her tactics are really awesome, one of the reasons I score an ‚ÄúA‚Äù in BM until SPM is because of her. Her math teaching skills are insane. I have 2 awesome math teachers, and I proudly say these are the teachers who are responsible for my math skills. The other teacher‚Äôs name is `Suzana`.

&nbsp; Their way is a bit harsh but really effective, teacher `Nurliza` will come to class and ask all the students to stand up, she will ask the math questions and whoever is able to answer it first, can sit. This creates a healthy competition among students and automatically makes us self study without any force ü§©. Teacher `Suzana` uses a cool and interactive method to teach, but when you don't get the answer right you will get a slap. It is not pain but the name of the slap `Pelempang Jepun`  makes you scared :confounded: and will make you self study.

<br />

&nbsp; Actually the list is really long, there are so many awesome teachers I had. I will list another two teachers, Teacher `Ashikin` and `Haslinda`. If one day any of my teachers read through this blog. I am really sorry teacher :sob: not mentioning your name, all of you guys are really awesome and wonderful. 

&nbsp; Let's see teacher `Haslinda` first, she is my english teacher. Best of the best, she is really a strict teacher but the knowledge that she gives is incomparable. She uses the same tactics as my math teachers, she will give a list of words for us to memorise then the next day she comes to class, all of us cannot sit until we spell the word right. Every student will compete with each other and it is really healthy. It was really a golden time :star2:. Next is Teacher `Ashikin`, she is my chess teacher, because of her I play chess until this day. One of the best brain games, she trusted me and chose me to represent school. It may seem normal to her but for me it is really something. Thank you teacher, every time I play chess it will make me remember you.

## Secondary Teachers

&nbsp; My Secondary teachers are one of a kind, all of them are so cool and they really give the knowledge to us with the hope of we will succeed in the future. One of the best among them is `‚ÄùTAF‚Äù Tong Ah Fook`, he is my accounts teacher. He literally stayed with us and helped us do the assignment. He forced us to come to school and guide us step by step. He is really awesome, he will make sure even the laziest person in the class scores in his subject. He believes these scores will help his students in future.

&nbsp; Another teacher is `Pn Paridah`, she was my class teacher when I was in form 5. She literally calls my parents and make sure they come to _Report Card_ day. I never tell my parents about _Report Card_ day. My parents are like other parents also, haha when they see the result is bad they will be sad, so I didn‚Äôt tell them. Even though my final year exams I always score quite well but my other exams I usually have low marks. So I never invited my parents to come, this time she called them and made them come. She told my parents about me being _talkative_ and _not doing homework_. At the end of the year she was the one who praised me. Most of the Teachers always have a pure soul, they do things for our own good. There are many more teachers in my secondary school that are awesome but these two teachers really touched me. Special mention is cikgu ‚ÄúQudzi‚Äù. Thank you Teachers.

## College

&nbsp; In college I met with awesome gurus, they are not like primary and secondary teachers. They care a bit less but they are genuine. They teach with pure heart and make sure they deliver it properly. I will mention all of them I guess, because these lectures are the one who made me ready for the working world. `Pn Siti Salina, Miss Cheah, Mr Salvatore, Mr Shahab, Mr John, Miss Vasugi`. No bias but my programming teachers are super cool, I am a good programmer now because of them. I really need to give this credit to `Mr Salvatore` :man_teacher:. He teaches me Java and because of his teaching style I become so good at programming. Thank You Teachers.

## Special Teachers

&nbsp; These are special people who teach me out of school, first of all are my parents. My `mom` and my `dad` üßî. My `mom` teaches me on school work and my `dad` teaches me different skills. He teaches me indirectly and directly. One of the best things is, he can calculate the discounts and I am so amazed with it. Imagine you are 10y/o and then your `dad` calculates it and then on the counter the amount is the same. So cool right? How he does it, he teaches me and until now I use that method. Besides that, always knowing the rules when doing something is the biggest thing I learn from him. Second is `Faiz`, this is another amazing teacher in my life. This is the person who makes me a teacher. He teaches me about computers. All of these are awesome golden memories, and now I learn many things from people around me. Last but not least Thank You Everyone :innocent:.
