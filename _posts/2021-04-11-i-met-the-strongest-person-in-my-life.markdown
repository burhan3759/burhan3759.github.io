&nbsp; This story is very close to my heart :heart:. I met the strongest person in my life, this person faced more hardship than good. I totally get it, everyone has hardships but we also know that there is a person that has a bit more bad luck than others. This person is not only strong but also brilliant and has an angel look.

&nbsp; Maybe it feels over exaggerated, for me this word really suits her. She has been working since a very very young age. Working at night markets and part time jobs to make her own living. Curse and lack of father’s love are the main factors that make her strong and rebellious. She is freaking smart and always gets good results even though she only attended the school for half a year. The main reason is, she needs to make her own living and has worked overtime since a very young age.

&nbsp; Good blessed her with a brilliant mind and beautiful face (at least for me :grimacing:). She inherited one thing from her mother, which is “Kelam Kabut”. It means, always kinda panic or rush when doing something. This happens because of lack of confidence in self and she is improving it greatly each time we meet. I am super impressed how she can adapt and improvise herself with the power of ignorance and ego :joy:.

&nbsp; She has this attitude, which is multi personality. She created many personalities based on her life journey. If you ask me, her journey is though, yes it is! Indeed there are many people around the globe who have more difficult lives but it does not mean her’s is not difficult. The difficulties are different but it is well beyond the difficulties that a normal kid will face. Ok done with that, let’s see why I say her strong.

&nbsp; The first thing that struck me to my heart is, she is a lone survivor. No siblings support and parent support. She has done and handled everything by her own since a very young age. I think I repeat this thing a few times but hell yeah. This is her charisma that shines like a bright star. Next is, she has been facing one of the worst enemy that a human being can get. Which is OCD and Depression. Maybe most of you never know what is OCD, OCD represent for “Obsessive Compulsive Disorder”

&nbsp; What does it do? It will make you lack confidence in areas that you have the OCD. You will check check check and check on it multiple times until you are really really really confident that you did it right. This sometimes can get super worse when you can’t make up your mind. It will cause tiredness, stress and hypertension. That’s all I can say about OCD, the key thing that I want to highlight is. Imagine this kind of person manages to come through her life and starts to get successful. Not only that, I will repeat this again, “SHE IS SMART” just Kelam :joy:

&nbsp; Next is Depression, despite having this depression and it’s getting worse at University time she gets pretty good results. I am amazed with how she handles her life and daily routine with only the things she has. Why do I say this? Because I believe all of us are doing the same. What I really mean here is, she has financial issues and only by using limited things, she did it really well and didn’t blabber it. Of Course sometimes when it reaches the limit she will burst it out, that is very normal. On most cases she is very cool :sunglasses:

&nbsp; I think that’s all about her. I think If I really want to write about her, it will be a novel :rofl:, since this is a short story I will keep until here only. Whenever I read this, it will recall all the memories with her. Just a hint, this person will be an important person in my life journey :grin: and My Grandma is another super strong person as well. That’s it, let's end the story and chill out. Be strong my dear, you are Wonder Woman.
