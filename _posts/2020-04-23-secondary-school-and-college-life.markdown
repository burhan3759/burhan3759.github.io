&nbsp; Hello my dear fans :smiling_imp:, this topic is about my `Secondary School` and `College Life`. Let’s begin with my secondary school, few of my cousins join that school so I follow their footsteps. It feels really great to start a new adventure.

## Secondary School

&nbsp; In my primary school I am a very shy person, but in secondary school I changed. The change is good, The change makes me achieve few things. When I was in form 1, I met a wonderful person in my life and life is really surprising. I had good teachers and cool friends. When I was in form 1, I always played games after school at the nearest cyber cafe and that was the only year that I was addicted to cyber cafes. Once I step up to Form 2, I never reach my feet to cyber cafes again. That place became boring and I found more interesting things to do, which is playing actual football.

&nbsp; Fast forward to Form 5, I am a leader for my sports house. My sports color was blue `KASTURI`. Life gave me another chance to work with the wonderful person that I met in form 1 and all of that is a collection of best memories. That person is still holding my `medal` :medal_sports: from our marathon :runner: events. I am not an A scorer student but my results are quite good. I guess I am a quick learner, last minute study really helped a lot. I have had an interest in the computing world since I was 14 years old. After SPM I have a clear view where I should step my feet in. Side info, I have been selected for `National Service` and I attended it for 3 months, it is another great memory.

## College Life

&nbsp; My college life is another twist and turn. I really had no idea which college to join. I searched for colleges via google and attended a few education fairs. Lastly, I found this awesome college. I read through the course outline and I really like it. I enroll and begin my college life. First few semesters are quite nice, I have 20 ~ 25  people as my classmates. My college is kinda a dead place, not much food options but the lectures are good. I really like all my lectures, especially the one who taught me programming.

&nbsp; The second half of my diploma “I think semester 4”, I got to know the reality of computer science students.First :bomb: is!!! The class shrinks from 20+ students to only 6 students. Half way through that semester another student went missing and we ended with the magnificent 5. Trust me I got the best classmates ever. All my mates are not lazy ass, it indirectly drives me to be a better person. I failed 3 subjects, 1 subject I need to repeat the whole subject in a new semester and another 2 subjects I just need to repeat the exam. The funny part is, the lecturer asks me; `Burhan how come you fail` :thinking:. I told my lecturer I don’t know :rofl:.
  
&nbsp; Now comes the thrilling part, all my friends did not have any failed subject but I got 3 subjects :man_facepalming:. No worries, I got :fire: inside me and I promised myself to graduate together with them as a magnificent 5. The result didn’t drag me down at all, the fire inside me burnt it. I fight and work hard and pass all the subjects and graduate with them successfully  :tada: :confetti_ball:. Finally we completed our `Diploma in Computer Science`. We all join the Degree program in our same College. This time our degree is a collaboration with `Anglia Ruskin University UK`. We all are very lucky, we got a discount and a trip to the UK :uk: for free. This is the best study package ever. Good Friends, Good Lecturer, and a Trip to UK.

&nbsp; Fast forward, I had an awesome journey in my degree. I didn’t fail any subjects and I missed only `1 point` from being a first class honour student :sob:. If it is a mile, I will never care or sad but 1 point, really :laughing:. I guess I am a quite positive person, I just move forward and aim for the best in future. The UK trip was really eye-opening, sight-seeing, and educational, things and the culture at Cambridge city was really good. `Anglia Ruskin University` syllabus is good and up to date with current tech. Once again I would like to thank all my lecturers, friends and family. Overall I end up my college life with 5 classmates, we are really the magnificent 5. I studied at `HELP College of Arts & Technology`. Thanks to everyone that gives me these wonderful memories :sparkles:
