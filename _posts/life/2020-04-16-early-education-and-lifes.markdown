&nbsp; Normal healthy childhood, I am the eldest in my family and as you know the eldest got either special treatment or the worse `Haha`. I got the special one, my parents say I am a silent guy outside and very naughty inside the house. My dad is really cool, he always buys me a lot of toys, this makes me become adamant when I see a toy at a shop. I will cry and try to get that toy :laughing:. Yeah that’s me when I was young. But age changed me, I became a better person. I use my brother now to get what I want :smiling_imp: he is more adamant then me `HAHAHA`. I missed that childhood

### Early Education

&nbsp;My parents put me into kindergarten when I was 4 y/o :cry:. But it was so fun to me, I got many friends and learned so many exciting things. You know what, actually I don't remember much about kindergarten :laughing:. Let’s move to primary school, this is one hell of an awesome experience in my life. I met so many friends but only close to a few of my naughty friends. I really can’t forget my primary schools, very nice die hard friends. I had great teachers and thanks to them I am here now. I was never a topper at school, most of the time I got a few numbers from back :sweat_smile: but numbers are just numbers, it will never stop my success.

### My Daily Task

&nbsp; My neighbours and cousins are the same age as me, so you know what it means. It means unlimited enjoyment. After school, from 5.00 pm ~ 7.00 pm is play time. We are seasonal, we play using whatever we have and most of the time football on the road. I played most of the games on the road. It was one hell of a great feeling. I really wish I could go back to that time. Games that I played `Hide & Seek`, `Police & Thief`, `Tag / Run & Chase`, `YuGiOh`, `Beyblade`, `Crush Gear`, `Uno`, `Dam / Checker`, `Congkak`, `Skipping`, `Badminton`, `Bicycle`, `Football` and we even fight sometimes. Time really flies but good memories always stay. I had a wonderful childhood. Hopefully you guys have it also, let’s remember it for a moment and appreciate our moments.
