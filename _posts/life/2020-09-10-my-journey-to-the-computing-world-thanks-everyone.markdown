&nbsp; The journey to the Computing world, in this topic I will mention the people who pushed me into computing world. As usual, let's start from the beginning. As all normal kids, whenever I asked what I am going to be in future, the answer will be  _"Police"_, _“Doctor”_, _“Lawyer”_, and you guys know the list. Never in a thousand times I thought I would be a software engineer  and I never knew this kinda job existed at that time. So, where does all of this begin? Here come the first character that are responsible for it; **Azhar**, he is my cousin and he is one year older than me. in 2007, we went to INDIA :india: and I have no idea how `he got this idea` of getting involved in the computing world, I guess it is inside the indian genes :rofl: :rofl:.

## The First & Second

&nbsp; Once we back to Malaysia :malaysia:, `I totally forgot about it` but not him. He went to look for a computer training center and he found one :clap:. He told me about it and I told my parents about it, and my parents totally supported me and didn’t ask any questions :innocent:. Second, My parents are another main reason why I am in computing world. Full support without any rules, in fact they don’t even know what course of computing I am going to study. They just support me. Feel so blessed and awesome. The first course that I took is “Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, & PowerPoint)”. Had a wonderful teacher and we learned fast. But this Microsoft Office is not the reason I me into the computing world.

&nbsp; PC maintenance :hammer_and_wrench: is the course that attracts me to the computing world. The teacher who taught me showed some basic programming using `batch file`. It looks so cool and most importantly looks like a hacker :bust_in_silhouette:. At this time I made up my mind to become a Network guy, reason? I actually don’t know the actual reason. My best guess is, my teacher is good in networking and he look like a very pro, so that is how I made up my mind to become a networking guy

## The Dive

&nbsp; I take a diploma & degree in `Computer Science`, at this time still I want to become a Network engineer. Here comes the 3rd and most important person that makes me a programmer. Of course another main reason is the teacher but he is the one that pulls the trigger :gun:. His name is **Joel**. He is my classmate and he is the main reason I do coding now. The story begins like this; 

`Far far away there is an island called <Hello World />` :joy: :joy:. Nah, it didn’t start like that. Let’s go to the actual story.

&nbsp; Joel got a freelance project and he invited anyone who is free to join. I am not sure why but somehow I say I wanna join. I didn’t do any coding until 1 month from the date line or so. Then Joel asked me,

<br />

> Conversation Mode: *ON*

**Joel** : did I do anything, if yes please show the work _(in the coding world we call “commit”)_

**Me** : I say to him, sorry bro I think I need to back off

**Joel** : (He nicely replied to me) it’s ok if you do little because you already promise to do some. Now if you backoff without doing anything it is not good

> This is the words that become a motivational speech to me and automagically I am so fired up to do the work.

> This become my first ever mobile app and I so much fall in love with Programming.

**Me** : Ok Joel, I will do it and brief me the task again. Thanks Man

> Conversation Mode: *OFF*

<br />

&nbsp; Done, this is basically the full story of how I become a programmer. The journey was so amazing and everytime I think about it I feel really blessed. Awesome partners and priceless experience. They are the 3 main figures whom is responsible. I would like to take this opportunity to Thank them million times and a 5 star for them :star2: :star2: :star2: :star2: :star2:. Thank You !!!

<br />
