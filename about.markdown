&nbsp;&nbsp; As a person, I am an unbelievable awesome person, Haha. Actually yeah, I am not a bad person to be friends with. Love sports, especially football and I play almost all sports that I have been given a chance to play. Recently I started reading books and I realize reading books is really something, you guys should start reading if not yet.

&nbsp;&nbsp; My long term plan is to open a Coding School :school: and teach people, especially young people. Speciality about my school is, not only I plan to teach code, I plan to teach them how to be a good human being also. As a saying goes, “I only can show the way” being good or bad depends on their decisions. Moreover I will focus more on unfortunate people and give them the knowledge.
