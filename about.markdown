&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi Guys let’s get to know about me. My name is Mohamed Burhanudeen, call me Burhan. I am a Software Developer for almost 4 years now, my expertise more on Javascript and PHP. I code in React Native, React, and Laravel and soon I plan to migrate more to a leadership position. I am the eldest in my family and I live in Kuala Lumpur, the magnificent capital city of Malaysia.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a person, I am an unbelievable awesome person Haha. I don’t wanna praise myself but yeah I am not a bad person to be friends with. Love sports, especially football and I play almost all sports that I have been given a chance. Recently I started reading books and I realize reading books is really something, you guys should start reading if not yet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My long term plan is to open a Coding School and teach people, especially young people. Speciality about my school is, not only I plan to teach code, I plan to teach them how to be a good human being also. As a saying goes, “I only can show the way” being good or bad depends on their decisions. Moreover I will focus more on unfortunate people and give them the knowledge.

My contact info is below, you guys can Email me, send Facebook request, or message me in LinkedIn
